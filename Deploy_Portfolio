Hi Chirag,

Aasmeen this side I just saw on Upwork that you want to deploy your portfolio on GitHub pages.
I have experience with the same here is my portfolio link `https://aasmeen.github.io/portfolio/` (the website is still in progress so yeah there are some issues with it).
I can help you with the same. If you like then you can contact me at aasmeen1700@gmail.com.
